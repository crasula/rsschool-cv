### Summary
I've been working as a school teacher for 6 years. Recently, I realized that my work doesn't bring me any pleasure, so I began to think about having a change of career. During my university years I really liked studying web technologies, so I decided to try my hand at this occupation and signed up for a "JS / FRONT-END. STAGE 0" course by [RS School](https://rs.school/).
